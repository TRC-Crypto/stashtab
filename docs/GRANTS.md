# Grants

Stashtab is funded through ecosystem grants that support the development of open-source infrastructure for onchain finance.

## Grant Philosophy

We apply for grants that:

- Support protocol integrations (Base, Aave, Morpho, etc.)
- Fund developer tooling and infrastructure
- Promote composable, open-source primitives
- Benefit the broader ecosystem, not just Stashtab

Grant funds are used for:

- Integration development (new protocols, chains)
- Documentation and examples
- Testing and security audits
- Developer experience improvements

## Grant Programs

### Applied For

_(No grants received yet - applications in progress)_

### In Progress

- **Base Builder Grants**: Application pending for Base-native finance primitives integration
- **Aave Grants DAO**: Proposal in preparation for composable Aave integration primitives

### Eligible For

- **Optimism RetroPGF**: Registering for future rounds (requires track record)
- **Gitcoin Grants**: Eligible for public goods funding rounds
- **Uniswap Foundation**: Potential for ecosystem tooling grants

## Grant Applications

### Base Builder Grants

**Focus**: Base ecosystem growth, developer tooling  
**Amount**: $5K–$50K  
**Status**: Application in preparation  
**Proposal Summary**: Stashtab as Base-native finance primitives - making it trivially easy for developers to build financial products on Base rails with composable yield, payment, and fiat primitives.

### Aave Grants DAO

**Focus**: Aave v3 integration, yield routing  
**Amount**: $5K–$50K  
**Status**: Proposal in preparation  
**Proposal Summary**: Composable Aave integration primitives - enhanced Aave SDK, yield router development, and documentation for building on top of Aave.

### Optimism RetroPGF

**Focus**: Public goods funding  
**Amount**: $10K–$100K+  
**Status**: Registering for future rounds  
**Requirements**: Track record of usage and impact

## Grant Usage

When grants are received, funds will be used for:

1. **Protocol Integrations** (60%)
   - Morpho Finance integration
   - Additional yield protocol support
   - Multi-chain expansion

2. **Developer Experience** (25%)
   - Documentation improvements
   - Example implementations
   - Testing infrastructure

3. **Security & Audits** (10%)
   - Code audits
   - Security reviews
   - Best practices documentation

4. **Ecosystem Support** (5%)
   - Community support
   - Bug fixes
