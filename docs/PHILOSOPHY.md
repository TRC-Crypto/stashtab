## The Post-DeFi Thesis

"DeFi is dead."

Not as a technology—as a category. The distinction between "DeFi" and "TradFi" is collapsing. In a few years, there will just be finance—running on better rails.

As [Maple Finance CEO Sid Powell articulates](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/21/defi-is-dead-maple-finance-s-ceo-says-onchain-markets-will-swallow-wall-street):

> "In a couple of years, institutions won't distinguish between DeFi and TradFi at all. Eventually, all capital markets activity will take place onchain."

Stablecoins will process more volume than card networks. Yield will be transparent and programmable. Settlement will be instant. And users won't know or care that it's "crypto."

## What Stashtab Is

Stashtab is infrastructure for this transition.

Not a product. Not a company. A set of open-source primitives that anyone can use to build financial products on onchain rails.

We believe:

1. **Finance should be open.** The protocols exist. The tooling should too.
2. **Blockchain is plumbing, not product.** Users shouldn't see it.
3. **Composability beats monoliths.** Use what you need, ignore the rest.
4. **Security through transparency.** Open source, auditable, forkable.
5. **Primitives over products.** Build infrastructure, not applications.

## What Stashtab Is Not

- A token
- A company
- A VC-backed startup
- A product competing for users
- A managed service
- A closed ecosystem

## The Primitive Approach

Traditional financial infrastructure is monolithic. You get everything or nothing. You're locked into one provider's stack.

Stashtab takes a different approach: **primitives**.

Primitives are small, composable building blocks. Each one does one thing well:

- **Account primitives**: Safe deployment, session keys
- **Yield primitives**: Aave, Morpho, routing
- **Payment primitives**: Transfers, batch payments, streaming
- **Fiat primitives**: Onramps, offramps, provider routing
- **Compliance primitives**: KYC, sanctions screening, reporting

Builders compose these primitives into whatever they need:

- A neobank? Combine accounts + yield + payments + fiat
- A payroll system? Use payments + compliance
- A treasury tool? Use yield + accounts + reporting

No lock-in. No vendor dependency. Just useful code.

## Sustainability

Stashtab is maintained as a public good, funded by:

- **Ecosystem grants** from protocols we integrate (Base, Aave, Optimism)
- **Community sponsorships** via GitHub Sponsors
- **Developer adoption** through forks and contributions

No token. No rent-seeking. No company structure. Just useful code that helps builders ship.

## The Long View

Finance is moving onchain. Not because it's cool, but because it's better:

- **Lower costs**: No intermediaries taking cuts
- **Faster settlement**: Instant vs days
- **Transparency**: All on public ledgers
- **Programmability**: Money becomes software
- **Global access**: Anyone, anywhere, anytime

Stashtab exists to make this transition easier. We're not building the future of finance—we're building the tools that let others build it.

## Open Source First

Everything is MIT licensed. No dual licensing. No commercial restrictions.

Why? Because infrastructure should be free. The value is in what you build on top, not the plumbing itself.

If you're using Stashtab in production, consider:

- Sponsoring development via GitHub Sponsors
- Contributing code or documentation
- Sharing your use case
- Applying for grants that benefit the ecosystem

But you're never required to pay. The code is yours to use, modify, and build on.

**The future of finance is onchain. Stashtab helps you build it.**
